Ian must analyze the results of an internal vulnerability scan to be run on website hosting servers. The code is written in Java and his team lead wants to it for buffer overflow vulnerabilities using the SAINT scanning tool. Why should Ian discourage his team lead from this avenue?

(Java is not vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks)
Because Java uses a sandbox to isolate code, it is not vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. Most web, application servers and web application environments are actually susceptible to buffer overflows. However, environments written in interpreted languages such as Java or Python are a notable exception. They are immune to these attacks (except for overflows within an Interpreter).

d. Implementing Access control list filtering to allow only access to the read-write community from approved stations or subnets can be an effective countermeasure against unauthorized SNMP enumeration.

The IP Network Browser will scan a specific IP subnet and displays the devices that are actively responding on that subnet. It will then query the devices that responded through SNMP. Which of the below ports would be used by IP Network Browser to scan devices with SNMP enabled?

Because SNMP is not generally audited it can pose a significant threat, particularly if it has not been configured properly. Attackers are likely aware that SNMP can be used for account and device enumeration.
