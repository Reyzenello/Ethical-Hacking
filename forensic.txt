Forensic:

ProDiscover is a forensic tool.. i mainly used this to capture the state of the device but for more info you should definetly check out this: https://www.prodiscover.com/
Action--> Capture Image 
--ADD + <fill out the fields> 

To generate a report you must restart the device 

Forensic on kali:

-kali:
gparted 

fdisk -l 
mdir /mnt/sdb1
leafpad /etc/fstap

insert in the last row:
/dev/sdb1  /mnt/sdb1  vfat  defaults  0  0

gparted --> mount on /mnt/sdb1

cd /mnt/sdb1
mkdir case01
cd case01

dd if=/dev/sdb1 conv=sync,noerror bs=64K | gzip -c | split -b 2000m - /system_drive_backup.img.gz

then we need to take the file so system_drive_backup.img.gz and we will put into /mnt/sdb1/case01

gparted 

unmount dev/sdb1

sudo reboot
